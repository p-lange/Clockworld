### Skill Categories
Skills are grouped based on a similarity in use or function. There are no rules behind these categories, they are simply there for organizational purposes.
 
### What are Skills for?
Your Skills determine what sort of Actions you are good at. Each Skill grants you a bonus to your die rolls when attempting to perform Actions relevant to that Skill. For example, if you have a +2 Bonus in the Athletics Skill, you add +2 to your d10 rolls when attempting to perform Actions such as Movement and Endure, or the Take Cover Reaction. Every non-Trivial Action a character takes is generally tied to one or more Skills. If you have training in multiple Skills that can affect a single Action, you choose which Skill you are using when you make the check.

If you attempt to perform some activity not normally covered by the listed Actions, simply determine which Skill might be used to perform it and use that Skill’s bonus. 

>*For example, Mudo is attempting to juggle his hunting knife to impress some onlookers. This isn’t a pre-written Action, so instead the GM simply calls for Mudo to roll a Rank Check using his Knives Skill.*
 
### Improving your Skills
Throughout play, the GM will award the players Experience Points (XP) after completing a scenario or performing good role-playing. XP is given a few points at a time, usually ranging from 1 to 5 points. XP is given in “Chunks”, which limit how the XP can be spent. No matter what type of XP Chunk you received or the amount of XP within the Chunk, you can only spend one XP per Skill. The standard XP Chunk for completing a Scenario is (5), however easier or more challenging Scenarios may justify more or less reward. You cannot “save” XP for later use. It is spent immediately upon receipt.
 
When you spend XP, you simply check-off the next bubble on the Skill Page for the Skill you wish to improve. Once you have filled in enough bubbles, your Bonus to checks with that Skill increases, and so will your Rank.
 
>*For example, after defeating a group of bandits, Mudo is awarded +3 Free XP by the GM. Mudo decides to spend one point in his Handguns Skill, one in Hand-to-Hand, and the third in Athletics. He could not, however, place two points into his Handgun Skill.*
