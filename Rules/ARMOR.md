Wearing Armor in Clockworld doesn't require a particular Skill or any special training. However, wearing Armor comes with drawbacks - reductions in your Speed, Low Rolling on certain Checks, and so on.

Different types of Armor protect different parts of your body. Generally, lighter armor only protects your Bulk, while heavier armor protects the Brim and Ace as well. 

The "Protects" column specifies which Targets on your body are protected. The "Injury Type" column specifies which types of Injuries that area is Resistant to. The "Properties" column specifies what drawbacks you suffer from while wearing the armor.

**Donning or doffing armor** - most Armor takes (1) minute to don or doff, though any Armor with the Heavy or Restrictive properties takes (5) minutes. Shields, on the other hand, only require an Action to wield. 

### Shields

While you are wielding a Shield, you can use it to make Block Checks. Additionally, when you take the Defend Action while wielding a Shield, you gain Cover against all Attacks from sources you are Facing.
