Wearing Armor in Clockworld doesn't require a particular Skill or any special training. However, wearing Armor comes with drawbacks - reductions in your Speed, Low Rolling on certain Checks, and so on.

Different types of Armor protect different parts of your character's body. Generally, lighter armor only protects the Bulk, while heavier armor protects the Brim and Ace as well. 

The "Protects" column specifies which Targets on your character's body are protected. The "Injury Type" column specifies which types of Injuries that area is Resistant to. The "Properties" column specifies what drawbacks your character suffers from while wearing the armor.

**Donning or doffing armor** - most Armor takes (1) minute to don or doff, though any Armor with the Heavy or Restrictive properties take (5) minutes. Shields, on the other hand, only require an Action to equip. [Is it an action to remove as well? - Daniel] 

### Shields

While your character has a shield equipped, they can use it to make Block Checks. Additionally, when your character uses the Defend Action while they have a Shield equipped, they have Cover against all Attacks from sources they are Facing.
