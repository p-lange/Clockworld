## CONDITIONS

**Distracted** - Low Roll all Checks, and you cannot automatically succeed on Checks.

**Unaware** - Cannot take Reactions and other characters High Roll Attacks and Contests against you.

**Immobilized** - Unable to move or change facing.

**Prone** - on the ground, either lying prostrate or crouched. You have Cover against Ranged Attacks, but you Low Roll all Reactions.

**Staggered** - May only perform one Action during your Turn.

**Stunned** - You may not take any Actions or Reactions.

**Vulnerable** - Upgrade the severity of the Injury received by one step. A Mild result becomes Serious, a Serious becomes Critical, and a Critical result becomes instant death.

**Resistant** - Downgrade the severity of any Injury taken by one step. A Critical result becomes Serious, a Serious becomes Mild, and a Mild result is negated entirely.

**Dying** - Unconscious, and need to make an Endure Check at the end of each of your Turns. Three failures results in death.

**In Shock** - Need to make Endure Checks to stop from entering the Dying Condition. If you're Seriously Injured, the Check is made at the end of every minute; if you're Critically Injured, the Check is made at the end of each of your Turns.

**At Your Mercy** -  When a victim is entirely unable to defend themselves, whether they're tied up, unconscious, or otherwise completely restrained, they are considered At Your Mercy. Instead of rolling an Attack against the Target while they're within your Reach, simply choose a Location and apply whatever level of Injury you wish to that location. If you target a Vulnerable location, you can choose to instantly kill the target, by snapping their neck, shooting them in the face, or otherwise guaranteeing death.

**Burning** - Set on fire, covered in burning acid, etc. If one location on your body is on Burning, it takes a Mild Injury at the end of each of your Turns until you Shake it Off or douse it in water. If more than one location on your body is Burning, you instead take a Serious Injury at the end of each of your Turns. While Burning, you are Distracted with pain.

**Pinned** - Immobilized and unable to use either your arms and legs.

**Impeded** - slightly restrained, entangled, or hampered. While Impeded, you Low Roll all Reactions.

**Encumbered** - weighed down or so exhausted you canâ€™t move yourself easily. Your Speed is reduced by half and you Low Roll all Move Checks.

### DURATION

Some abilities or effects that apply a Condition may specify how long that Condition lasts. This is usually represented by some time value, like "10 minutes" or "1 hour". However, some Conditions can be ended early if the victim successfully **Shakes it Off**. This is a special Action that allows you to roll a new Endure, Escape, or Resist Check against each Condition you are suffering from that specifies that it can be Shaken Off. Like any other Action, you can focus on this Action to High Roll it. If you succeed on your Check, you remove that Condition.
