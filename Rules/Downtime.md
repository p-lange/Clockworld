# TAKING A BREATHER
During a Scenario, the GM may allow the Players to Take a Breather. This represents a few precious minutes of downtime where the Players can patch-up their Injuries, reload their weapons, and take stock of the situation. All Characters can resolve the following, and are assumed to have a done so unless otherwise stated by the Players.
* Remove all Mild Injuries from all Characters.
* Automatically Stabilize any Injured Characters.
* Reload all weapons, if sufficient ammunition is available.

# MOMENTS OF REPRIEVE
Between your Scenarios, you’ll sometimes have time to relax and recovery before starting your next endeavor. The GM can provide the Players with a Moment of Reprieve - a time when their lives are not imperilled, when they can take the time to prepare and relax. A Moment of Reprieve could be a single evening or a few days - it’s purposefully open-ended. It is the downtime between Scenarios, the montage of what each Character is doing to pass the time. During your Reprieve, you Advance for Skills. Additionally, choose one  Reprieve Activity from those below, or discuss with your GM if you want to do something different. Your Character spends their Reprieve pursuing that activity and gaining its benefits.

## Advance Your Skills
When you have a Moment of Reprieve, you may Advance for your Skills. You can Advance your Skills up to (4) times, but you can Advance any single Skill no more than **twice** during your Reprieve. For example, Mudo decides to Advance his Handguns Skills twice, his Athletics once, and his Reflexes once. He couldn't advance his Handguns Skill three times.

## Reprieve Activities [Choose One]

### Recover from Injuries
You can spend your Reprieve seeking medical care, resting and tending to your wounds. All of your Serious and Mild Injuries are removed. If you have access to medical care from trained physicians, your Critical Injuries are removed as well. Otherwise, any Critical Injury is downgraded to a Serious Injury.

### Procure Items
Need something not normally available where you’re taking your Reprieve? This activity allows you to seek out blackmarkets, find a nearby travelling salesman, or otherwise find something you can’t normally gain. You can find items with a total combined value of ($25) or less. You may purchase these items as normal, regardless of where you are.

### Seek Comforts
Relax the mind and body through, partaking in any manner of activity that can destress and restore the soul. This can be really anything, so long as it makes sense for your location - from having drinks with friends to praying at the local church, whatever fills your bucket, so to speak. Once at any time before your next Moment of Reprieve, you can choose to High Roll all Personality Skill Checks you make for (1) Turn.

### Revelry
Drink heavily, gamble, get into trouble with the wrong type of crowd. Revelry can lead to unpredictable results, some good, some bad! It’s a roll of the dice! Roll a d4 if you’re in the wilderness, or a d10 if you’re in a town, then consult the following table:

| Roll | Result |
| :----: | ---- |
| 1 | You gain a Mild Exhaustion Injury and your Speed is reduced by (5) feet until your next Moment of Reprieve. |
| 2 | Low Roll all Endure Checks against toxins and exhaustion until your next Moment of Reprieve. |
| 3 | High Roll all Endure Checks to avoid becoming exhausted or from suffering the effects of toxins until your next Moment of Reprieve. |
| 4 | High Roll all Resist Checks against fear or pain until your next Moment of Reprieve. |
| 5 | Someone owes you favor, determined by the GM. |
| 6 | The people in the town now have a favorable view of you, and you are recognized in that town next time you return. |
| 7 | Gain (4d10) dollars. |
| 8 | Lose (2d6) dollars. |
| 9 | Low Roll all Resist Checks until your next Moment of Reprieve. |
| 10 | Suffer a Serious Injury to a random location. |
