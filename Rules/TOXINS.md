# Toxins
Serums, drugs, poisons - the world of Clockworld has many chemical dangers. Toxins include both naturally occuring venoms, like that of a rattle snake, to artificial drugs and stimulants, like Samson's Blood or Good Night Kiss.

When exposed to a Toxin, you immediately make an Endure Check against the Rank of the Toxin. If you fail, you suffer the effects for the listed time. You may continue to make Endure Checks against the Toxin at the listed time intervals. If you succeed, you are no longer affected by the Toxin.

Some Toxins are beneficial and do not require Endure Checks. These are denoted by "None" in the Rank column. Ingesting one of these automatically grants its effects.
