# Toxins
Serums, drugs, poisons - the world of Clockworld has many chemical dangers. Toxins include both naturally occuring venoms, like that of a rattle snake, and artificial drugs and stimulants, like Samson's Blood or Good Night Kiss.

When exposed to a Toxin, you immediately make an Endure Check against the Rank of the Toxin. If you fail, your character suffers the effects of that toxin for the listed time. You may continue to make Endure Checks against the Toxin at the listed time intervals. If you succeed, your character is no longer affected by the Toxin.

Some Toxins are beneficial and do not require Endure Checks. These are denoted by "None" in the Rank column. Ingesting one of these automatically grants its effects.

Name | Rank | Spread by | Time Interval | Effects
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Foxglove | Adept | Ingestion | Hour | Distracted with pain for 4 hours.
Good Night Kiss | Adept | Contact, Ingestion | None | After 1 minute, fall unconscious for 1 hour.
Arsenic | Inhuman | Ingestion | Turn | Gain a Critical Injury which causes you to be Stunned and Low Roll Shock Checks. Once you succeed on an Endure Check, the Injury is removed.
Devil Grass | Novice | Ingestion, Inhalation | None | High Roll Acuity Checks, but Low Roll Resist Checks for 1 hour.
Snake Venom | Master | Injury | Minute | Gain a Critical Injury, which goes away after 1 hour, or until you succeed on your Endure Check.
Alcohol | Layman | Ingestion | Hour | Each drink increases the Difficulty by (1) Rank. Each failure makes the condition worse. The effects are cumulative, and last 1 hour. (1) Failure: Low Roll all Acuity Checks, but High Roll Resist Checks; (2) Failures: Staggered; (3) Failures: Unconscious.
Samson's Blood | None | Ingestion | None | Become Inhuman Rank in Might and Athletics, and High Roll all Reach Attacks. After 1 minute,  the benefits end and your character goes into Shock.
Fortifying Drought | None | Ingestion | None | High Roll Shock Checks for 1 hour, and if you succeed twice in a row, your character Stabilizes. However, First Aid Checks are Low Rolled when used on your character.
Anti-tox | None | Ingestion | None | High Roll Endure Checks against Toxins for 1 hour, and immediately roll an Endure Check for each Toxin afflicting your character, removing them if you succeed.
