## Player Turn and Threat Turn
Within a Scenario, each side of the encounter - the Players, composed of the Player Characters (PCs) and their allies; and the Threats, composed of the villains, monsters, and hazards controlled by the GM, alternate performing their Actions. One side performs all of their Actions, in any order and intermixed with one another, then their foes perform theirs in a similar manner. This alternating continues until the Scenario is complete, such as when one side surrenders or is wiped out. The type of Scenario, constructed by the GM, will dictate how the Scenario can conclude.

This alternating Turn structure begins with whichever side initiated the conflict. If this unclear, then the GM can call for a Contest between the most relevant Character(s) on each side to determine who goes first.

## Round
A Round is from any point in time until the start of the acting Character’s next Turn. For example, if during the Threat Turn a Player Character (PC) becomes Staggered for one Round, then the Staggered Condition would last until the start of the next Threat Turn.

## TURN
On your Turn, you may perform up to two different Actions and any number of Incidentals, within reason. You may take your Actions before or after those of the other Characters that share your Turn. For example, you may perform a Move, then an ally could make an Attack, then you could make an Attack. At any point during your Turn, you may also choose your Facing. 

**_Focusing on an Action_**
Instead of taking two Actions, you can focus on one Action. Focusing on an Action lets you High Roll any Checks you make for that Action. Some Actions, such as Move and Defend, gain additional benefits from focusing on them.

There are (5) types of Actions you can perform.

* **Attack** - make a Weapon Attack. You can perform two Attack Actions on your Turn if each Attack uses a different limb and weapon.
* **Contest** - perform a Contest, such as Disarming or Distracting a foe.
* **Move** - move a distance up to your Speed, including traversing terrain. You may take your other Action at any point during the movement. When you focus on your Move, you may move (15ft) more, in addition to High Rolling any Checks.
* **Task** - perform a Task, like picking a lock or breaking down a door. You can perform two Task Actions on your turn as long as they are different Tasks.
* **Defend** - gain an additional Reaction until the start of your next Turn. When you focus on Defending, you High Roll all Reactions until the start of your next Turn.

## Checks
Actions require you to roll a check to determine the success or failure of that action. A Check is performed by rolling a d10 and adding your Bonus from the relevant Skill, as well as any other modifiers, such as High Roll or Low Roll. Depending on the Action you’re using to make the Check, it is either compared against a Task Rank or the Contest of another Character, or both.

### High Roll and Low Roll
Frequently, circumstances will be in a character's favor, or against them. This often comes in the form of High Rolling and Low Rollg a Check. When you High Roll a Check, you roll 2d10 and take the higher of the two results. When you Low Roll a Check, you roll 2d10 and take the lower of the two results, and you do not automatically succeed on Tasks with a Rank lower than your Skill Rank. If circumstances would cause you to both High Roll and Low Roll a Check, they cancel each other out, no matter how many instances of High Roll or Low Roll you have.

>*For example, Mudo is chasing a Bandit through a large crowd. Due to the loud noise and bustling people, Mudo would Low Roll his Acuity Check to locate the fleeing bandit. To counteract this, Mudo focuses on his Acuity Check, which would let him Righ Roll it. The two situations cancel each other out. If Mudo was also suffering from a fear effect that causes him to Low Roll his Checks, it would still be cancelled out by focusing on the Acuity Check.*

## Attacks
Attacks are the primary method for inflicting Injuries on your foes. To Attack, you must choose a Target. A Target is not just a particular character or object, but also where on that character or object you are trying to strike or hit, such as the head or arm on a person or the windows of a house. All Targets can be classified as one of three types: Bulk, Brim, and Ace.

#### Target
* Bulk: No modifiers.
* Brim: (+1) Rank, Injuries can potentially maim.
* Ace: (+2) Rank to strike a Vulnerable location.

The Bulk is the center-of-mass of a character, the largest, most prominent part. On humans or human-shaped creatures, this would be the chest.

The Brim includes the extremities of a character, such as the arms and legs. Serious or Critical Injuries inflicted to a limb cause the limb to be non-functional until the Injury has been treated. 

The Ace includes any of the most critical, vital, and vulnerable parts of the body, such as the head, eyes, heart, or groin. Striking the Ace is very deadly, as it is a Vulnerable location.

#### Range
The distance between you and the Target determines the base Rank you have to beat with your Check. Different weapons have different Ranges - some can only strike foes within your Reach (5 feet, normally), while others can fire great distances.

* Reach: Layman
* Close Range (within 30 feet): Novice
* Long Range (within 100 feet): Adept
* Extreme Range (within 1,000 feet): Master

This Rank is then modified by the Target (Bulk, Brim, or Ace), as well as by the presence of Cover or Concealment. Cover and Concealment both increase the Rank by (+1).

If the Target is a Character, it can use a Reaction to attempt to defend itself from your Attack, such as Block, Dodge, or Take Cover. See the section on Reactions later in this chapter.

#### Injury Pool
When you successfully Attack a Target, you may inflict an Injury. Assemble an Injury Pool to determine the severity of the Injury inflicted. You roll all the dice in the pool - if you have any results of (1) on your Injury Roll, then you inflict a Critical Injury. A result of (2) or (3) inflicts a Serious Injury. Any other result is a Mild Injury.

The type of dice used in the pool is determined by your weapon, while the number of dice is determined by your Rank in the associated Skill.

Skill Rank | Base Pool
--- | ---
Layman | 1
Novice | 2
Adept | 3
Master | 4

**Pulling Punches** - a character may choose to roll fewer dice than his maximum, to a minimum of 1.

>*For example, Mudo is an Adept with his Handguns. When he needs to roll for Injuries he inflicts with his trusty Revolver, he rolls 3d8; (3) for his Adpet Rank, and d8s for Revolvers. He rolls his dice and gets a (1), (5), and (7) - this means he inflicted a Critical Injury.*

#### Types of Attacks
**Reach Attack** - Strike a foe within your Reach (generally 5-feet) using a weapon, object, or body part. Describe the assault, including where and how you attempt to strike your victim: in the Bulk, Brim, or Ace. This determines the Difficulty and potential deadliness of the blow. Block and Dodge can be used to React to Reach Attacks.

**Ranged Attack** - Fire, throw, or launch a Ranged Weapon at a Target within the maximum Range of the weapon. Describe the assault, including where and how you attempt to strike your victim: in the Bulk, Brim, or Ace. This determines the Difficulty and potential deadliness of the Attack. The further away the Target, the harder the Difficulty. Blocking with a shield and Take Cover can be used to React to Ranged Attacks.

If you’re within the Reach of any hostile creatures when you make a Ranged Attack, you suffer Disadvantage on the roll.

**Area Attack** - Explosions and other sweeping effects cause Area Attacks. The Attack Roll is applied to everyone within the area, who can only use Take Cover to try to mitigate the effects. 

## Contests
Contests are generally offensive Actions that can hinder, distract, or manipulate foes without directly causing Injury. They run the gamut from physical manipulation, such as Shove, to more subtle manipulation, such as Persuade. 

A Contest involves all characters rolling a relevant Check and comparing the results. The initiator of the Contest succeeds on his Action against anyone who’s Check he beats. The Characters involved in a Contest do not need to use a Reaction to defend themselves - they simply roll their relevant Check as part of the resolution of the Action. Like Attacks, you must choose a Target or Targets when making a Contest - simply choose the Character you wish to affect.
* **Distract** - Harry, intimidate, or otherwise annoy a Target who can see or hear you. If you successfully beat the Target’s Resist Check, they become Distracted on all Checks against you, or all Checks that are not against you, depending on the nature of your Distraction. For example, if you threaten a bandit and use your Bravado to intimidate him, he might become afraid of you and and become Distracted when attempting to fight you, but not others. Conversely, if you insult the bandit and really get under his skin with Guile, he would become focused on you and become Distracted on any Checks in relation to your allies. The Target remains Distracted for one Round.
* **Persuade** - Convince another Character to behave a certain way for one Round, either through trickery, charm, or coercion. If you beat the Target’s Resist Check, they are forced to take a particular Action of your choice, within reason. The Target will not do anything suicidal or directly hostile toward its allies, but it might reveal a secret or drop an item its holding. The GM may have you High Roll or Low Roll the Check based on the circumstances. For example, you would Low Roll your Check to smooth-talk a bandit you’re currently trying to kill, but you might High Roll it if you’re attempting to intimidate that bandit into surrendering if you’ve recently killed his friends.
* **Deceive** - Tell a lie or perform an act. This Check is made against the Perceive of listeners or onlookers to determine if they find your words or actions believable. Failure means that they know something fishy is afoot, but may not know exactly what.
* **Endure** - Prevent your physical body from being manipulated or moved with Actions such as Shove or Trip, and resist the effects of poisons and diseases. Endure can also be used as a Task when attempting to perform a strenuous activity over long stretches of time, such as marathon running or holding your breath.
* **Shove** - Push a Target within your Reach away from you. If you beat the Target’s Endure Check, you move them up to 5 feet away from you. Forcing another Character to move does not count against their Speed nor does it allow other Characters to take Pot Shots against them. 
* **Trip** - Knock a Target within your Reach Prone. The Target may Contest with a Block, Dodge, or Endure Check. If you win the Contest, the Target is knocked Prone.
* **Disarm** - Knock an object loose that is within your Reach if it is held in hand or visible on a Character’s body. The Disarm Check is made against the wielder’s relevant Weapon Skill for Reach Weapons, or Hand-to-Hand in the case of any other held item or item holstered on the body. If you win the Contest, the item is knocked up to 10 feet away in a direction of your choice. If you have a hand free, you can instead wield the successfully Disarmed item.
* **Pin** - Attempt to hold-fast or tie-down a Target using either your hands, rope, or bindings. In order to attempt a Pin, you must have both hands free. The Target can Contest with either Endure or Escape. If you win the Contest, you Pin the Target (see Conditions) until you release them or they Shake it Off. Targets that are much larger than you either High Roll their Check or are immune to your Pin, at the GM’s discretion.
* **Strangle** - Attempt to choke a Target within your Reach. If you attempt to do this with only one hand, you Low Roll the Check. If you beat the Target’s Endure or Escape Check, they suffer one failure on a Shock Check, potentially causing them to lose consciousness, and Immobilize them for one Round or until they Escape or you release your grip. While you are Strangling someone, they cannot speak. If the Target doesn’t need to breathe, then they suffer no ill effects from being Strangled, except for the Immobilization.
* **Resist** - Resist the effects of mental assault, such as Distract or Persuade. The GM could also call for a Resist Check to stay awake for a long period of time or remain focused despite distracting circumstances, or when you are Targeted with certain Contests.

## Move
Moving encompasses all manner of movement, including traversing obstacles and challenging environmental situations. Simply walking or running does not require a Check. If there are obstacles in your way, such as walls, gaps, or bodies of water, you may have to make Checks to traverse them. These do not take a separate Action, they are simply made as part of your Move. The GM determines the Rank of the obstacle, which you must overcome with a Check, likely using the Athletics Skill. This follows the same structure as a Task (see below). If you succeed on the Check, you successfully traverse the terrain. If you fail, your Move stops and you cannot Move any further with that Action. All Move Tasks are Skill Capped (see below).

When you Move, you are assumed to be Facing in the direction you are Moving. If you wish to be Facing a different direction than the way you’re Moving, your Speed is reduced by half.

You may choose your Facing at the start and end of your Turn. As a Reaction, you can change your Facing at any time.

**Sneaking**: When you Move, you may attempt to do so Sneakily. At the end of your Movement, roll a Sneak Rank Check and compare it to the Perceive Ranks of those that could see or hear you. Characters whose Perceive you beat are Unaware of you and your Movement as long as you had Cover or Concealment throughout the Movement. If you Moved more than half your Speed while Sneaking, you Low Roll the Sneak Check.

You may also attempt to perform any other Action Sneakily. Simply roll the Sneak Check once you have completed the Action to determine who was Unaware.

Making an Attack automatically reveals you unless the weapon has the Silent Property.

## Tasks
Tasks cover interactions with objects and the environment. From picking a lock to tracking a coyote through the desert, Tasks cover a wide variety of situations.

A Task is a Check rolled against a Rank. The Rank of a Task determines how hard it is for a Character to succeed on it, and itself is generally determined by the complexity or difficulty of the activity you are attempting to perform.

In order to succeed on a Task, you must beat the number associated with the Task’s Rank, or be of higher Skill Rank than the Task Rank.

Difficulty | Number to beat | Auto if you are...
--- | :---: | ---
Layman | 3 | Novice
Novice | 5 | Adept
Adept | 7 | Master
Master | 9 | -
Inhuman | 11 | -
Legendary | 13 | -

* **Dismantle** - Take apart or otherwise make non-functional a mechanical object, such as the lock on a door, the wheel of a hubcap, or a firearm. The GM may determine that this is a Lengthy Task, requiring several Actions to complete.  
* **Crack** - Bypass the normal access to a locked or keyed object or machine, such as a safe or an automobile. If you succeed, you gain access or can control the object or machine. The GM may determine that this is a Lengthy Task, requiring several Actions to complete.
* **Break (Capped)** - Destroy or seriously damage an unattended object, such as a door or a window. 
* **Stabilize** - Stabilize a Character that is Seriously or Critically Injured. The Rank is Adept for Seriously Injured and Master for Critically Injured. Using a First Aid Kit reduces the Rank by (1).
* **Heft (Capped)** - Lift, push, or carry something very heavy, such as an unconscious person or a large crate. If you succeed on the Check, you can lift the object and carry it with you as you Move.
* **Escape** - Slip out of being Pinned, or avoid being Pinned in the first place as a Reaction. If you are Pinned with ropes or bindings, the Difficulty is against the Rank of the person who tied you up, or the Rank of the bindings (whichever is higher).
* **Track** - Locate and follow the signs of another creature’s movements. The Difficulty is highly variable, set by the GM. The freshness of the tracks and the type of material they were made in all increase the Difficulty.
* **Perceive** - Notice something is amiss, detect lies, and find hidden items or creatures. For finding hidden objects or other non-living things, the GM sets the Difficulty of this Rank Check. When a character attempts to Deceive you, you use Perceive to contest it. Characters attempting to Sneak by you roll against your Rank in Perceive.

### Lengthy Tasks
Some Tasks may take more than the few moments to complete, as determined by the GM. The lock on a safe might take several minutes to complete or tracking a criminal through the hills might take several hours. You roll the Check for a Lengthy Task at the end of the specified time period; during that time, you can do nothing else but perform the Task. If you wish to focus on completing a Lengthy Task in order to High Roll your Check, double the time it would take to complete.

### Skill Capped Tasks
Some Tasks are bound by the physical limitations and Skill of your character. No matter how much you try, you cannot suddenly Leap twice as far as you could before, nor can you suddenly lift twice as much weight. A Skill Capped Task can only be attempted if your character's Rank in the relevant Skill is no more than one lower than the Task Rank - otherwise, you automatically fail the Check. For example, in order to attempt to leap across a chasm that as a Task Rank of Adept, your character must be at least a Novice in Athletics - otherwise, they will automatically fail!

## Reactions
A Reaction is a special reactive or defensive ability that is done in response to the Actions of others, such as Blocking, Dodging, or Taking Cover. At the start of your Turn, you have (2) Reactions that you can use at any time before the start of your next Turn. You may only React with a single Reaction to any given Action, however multiple Characters can each use a Reaction in response to a single Action. A Reaction occurs before the Action that triggers it, possibly interfering with or preventing the original Action from succeeding.

In the case of an Attack, the Attacker must not only succeed on its Attack Check, but it also must beat the result of your Reaction.

* **Block** - Reacts to Reach and Ranged Attacks. If the Attacker fails to beat your Block Check, the Attack strikes the Blocking Object instead of the original Target. Only shields, or objects of similar size, can be used to Block Ranged Attacks.
* **Dodge** - Reacts to Attacks made within Reach only. If the Attacker fails to beat your Dodge Check, the Attack is avoided entirely.
* **Take Cover** - Reacts to Ranged and Area Attacks. Can only be used if there is Cover within (5) feet of you. If the Attacker fails to beat your Take Cover Check, then you successfully get behind the Cover, moving up to 5 feet and/or falling Prone. The Attack now resolves as normal, but with the Cover in place (possibly causing it to miss).
* **Pot Shot** - Reacts to Moves within your Reach. Make a Reach Attack against the Character before it starts to Move. It can React with a Dodge or Block, as normal for Reach Attacks.
* **Tumble** - Reacts to a fall. This is a Rank Check against a Difficulty based on how far you fell. 

## Incidentals	
Not everything a character can do requires an Action or is tied to a Skill. Drawing a weapon, kicking over an adjacent table for Cover, speaking a few sentences, or opening a door are all examples of Incidentals. A particular activity is Incidental if it could be accomplished with a quick movement of a limb or with very little effort.
 
You can perform as many Incidentals on your Turn as you like, within reason. A Turn lasts about 6 seconds, so anything that would require more time than that should not be possible. The GM should attempt to limit the length of in-character conversations during a Scenario. Clockworld is meant to be played with a fast pace, moving the action forward. Characters should only have time to speak a few quick lines to one another in the heat of battle.
 
Additionally, manipulating an object in the environment, such as a door, a table, or a weapon in your holster, is only considered Incidental the first time you interact with it. Any additional interactions with that particular object would require the use of an Action.
 
> _For example, Mudo gets into a firefight with a gang of bandits. Bullets start flying through the tavern where Mudo was enjoying a game of poker. On his Turn, Mudo kicks over the poker table (Incidental), draws his revolver (Incidental) and fires it at one of the bandits (Action). However, if Mudo wished to re-holster his firearm or move the table to grant Cover from a different angle on that same Turn, it would no longer be Incidental and would require his second Action._
