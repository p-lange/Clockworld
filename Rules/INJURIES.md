## INJURIES
When you successfully Attack a Target, you may inflict an Injury. Assemble an Injury Pool to determine the severity of the Injury inflicted.

### Injury Pool
The Injury Pool is determined by your Skill.

### Rank	Base Pool
* Layman: 1
* Novice: 2
* Adept:  3
* Master: 4

If you have any results of (1) on your Injury Roll, then you inflict a Critical Injury. A result of (2) or (3) inflicts a Serious Injury. Any other result is a Mild Injury. 

**Instant Death -** If you get a Critical Result against a Vulnerable location, the victim is killed outright.

**Pulling Punches -** a character may choose to roll less dice than his maximum, to a minimum of 1.

## Armor
Some Targets will be armored or more durable than normal, which makes them Resistant to some types of Injury. Generally, Armor will specify what parts of the body are protected and against what types of weapons. For example, a metal shield is Resistant to sharp weapons, while a padded helmet might be Resistant to blunt weapons.

## Recovering from Injuries
The Difficulty of any Rank Check to treat Injuries increases the more severe the Injuries are. Using a Medicine Kit reduces the Difficulty by (1).

* Mild: Novice
* Serious: Adept
* Critical: Master

**Mild** - With only a few moment’s time, you can clean up and address any minor nicks and scrapes. By spending one minute, you can remove all Mild Injuries from a patient.

**Serious** - Serious Injuries require 4 hours of treatment, each. During that time, a character receiving treatment cannot perform any strenuous activities. Participating in a strenuous activity resets the treatment time. However, a character can Craft or perform other light activities while receiving treatment.

**Critical** - Critical Injuries require a week of treatment. Like Serious Injuries, a character receiving treatment must cannot perform strenuous activities without resetting the treatment time.

### Shock
While you are Seriously or Critically Injured, you are at risk of going into Shock. At the end of every minute (Serious) or Turn (Critical) that you are Injured, you must make an Endure Rank Check. Failing three of these checks causes you to go into Shock until you either die or become Stable. When you go into Shock, you fall Prone. While in Shock, you are Helpless and continue to roll Endure Rank Checks to avoid dying (see below). 

### Dying
There are two ways to be killed: through Injuries, or through your Condition.

If you have enough Critical Injuries, you are dead. For PCs, that’s a total of (2) Critical Injuries.

If you are currently in Shock and fail three more Endure Rank Checks, you die. These failures remain until you’ve received Medical Rest.

### Stabilizing
While you are Seriously or Critically Injured, the Stabilize Action can be used to prevent you from going into Shock. The Difficulty increases with the severity of your Injuries (see below). If the Stabilize Action succeeds, you no longer need to make Endure Rank Checks to avoid going into Shock. Receiving any new Injury after Stabilization causes you to resume checking for Shock until you are Stabilized again.

Serious: Adept
Critical: Master
(-1) Difficulty if you are using a Medicine Kit [or gives Advantage]

### Falling

If you fall:
10ft - Mild injury
20ft - Serious injury
30ft - Critical injury
40 ft - Death

If you drop intentionally:
20ft - Mild injury
30ft - Serious injury
40ft - Critical injury
50ft - Death

Roll a d6 to determine where the injury is applied (1 head, 2 chest, 3 right arm, 4 left arm, 5 right leg, 6 left leg)

The circumstances of the fall could increase or decrease its deadliness. Falling onto soft snow would reduce the deadliness, while falling onto jagged rocks would increase it.

Random Injuries

Roll d12; that tells you location and injury? (4 locations [head, chest, leg, arm], 3 injury types [mild, serious, critical])
1- head critical
2- head serious
3- head mild
4- leg critical
5- leg serious
6- leg mild
7- arm critical
8- arm serious
9- arm mild
10- chest critical
11- chest serious
12- chest mild

Random Location: 1d4 (1: head, 2: arm, 3: leg, 4: chest)
