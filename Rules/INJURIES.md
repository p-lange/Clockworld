## INJURIES
Throughout play, Players and Threats alike will suffer Injuries. Injuries rcome in three grades of severity: Mild, Serious, and Critical. The more serious the Injury, the more debilitating it is and the more likely you are to go into Shock and die (see below).

A Player can suffer from (7) total Injuries without dying - that 8th Injury means death. There are (4) Mild Injury slots, (2) Serious, and (1) Critical. Once all the Injury boxes are filled of one type, any further Injuries of that type are filled in to the next most severe Injury boxes. Regardless of what the Injury Roll result said, the box that is filled in is what the severity of the Injury becomes.

>*For example, Mudo has taken quite a beating, having taken (4) Mild Injuries from thugs in a bar brawl. A thug punches him again, inflicting another Mild Injury. However, since there are no more spots for Mild Injuries, it fills in a Serious Injury slot on his sheet, and he'll need to start making Shock Checks just like if he had suffered an actual Serious Injury.*

## Mild Injuries
Scrapes, flesh wounds, bruises, and minor cuts - these are all instances of a Mild Injury. Being Mildly Injured doesn't have any negative effects, but suffer too many such Injuries and you can still die.
#### Recovering from Mild Injuries
With nothing but a few scraps of cloth and one minute, you recover from all of your Mild Injuries, patching and bandaging them up. 

## Serious Injuries
Gashes, lacerations, bleeding cuts, and badly sprained or even broken limbs - Serious Injuries are dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Being Seriously Injured can cause you to pass out in a matter of minutes, or even die.
### Recovering from Serioues Injuries
After a 8 hours of medical care, such as bandaging, splints, and stiches, your Serious Injuries are removed. 

## Critical Injuries
Gut shots, gushing wounds, and severed limbs - Critical Injuries are a matter of life or death. Without immediate attention, being Critically Injured are very likely to result in death via bleeding out, internal damage, or trauma.
### Recovering from Critical Injuries
After 5 days of medical care, you recover from your Critical Injuries.

**Instant Death -** If you suffer a Critical Injury to a Vulnerable spot on your body, you are killed immediately.

## Armor and Resistance
Some Targets will be armored or more durable than normal, which makes them Resistant to some types of Injury. Generally, Armor will specify what parts of the body are protected and against what types of weapons. For example, a metal shield is Resistant to sharp weapons, while a padded helmet might be Resistant to blunt weapons.

If a Target is Resistant to the type of Injury you are receiving, reduce its severity by one grade. Critical Injuries become Serious, Serious become Mild, and Mild are negated.

## Recovering from Injuries
The Difficulty of any Rank Check to treat Injuries increases the more severe the Injuries are. Using a Medicine Kit reduces the Difficulty by (1).

## Going into Shock
While you are Seriously or Critically Injured, you are at risk of going into Shock. At the end of every minute (Serious) or Turn (Critical) that you are Injured, you must make an Endure Rank Check. Failing three of these checks causes you to go into Shock until you either die or become Stable. When you go into Shock, you fall Prone and become Stunned and At the Mercy of others. After going into Shock, if you fail (3) more Endure Rank Checks, you die.

The difficulty of the Endure Rank Check depends on how severe your Injuries are:

Injury Level | Difficulty
--- | ---
Severely Injured | Adept
Critically Injured | Master

### Stabilizing
While you are Seriously or Critically Injured, the Stabilize Task can be used to prevent you from going into Shock. The Difficulty increases with the severity of your Injuries (see below). If the Stabilize Task succeeds, you no longer need to make Endure Rank Checks to avoid going into Shock and any failures on the Endure Checks are erased. Receiving any new Injury after becoming Stablized causes you to resume checking for Shock until you are Stabilized again.

The Difficulty of the Stabilize Task is determined by how severely Injured the recipient is:

Injury Level | Difficulty
--- | ---
Severely Injured | Adept
Critically Injured | Master

If you have a First Aid kit, you may High Roll this Check.

## Falling
When you take a tumble from great heights, you can suffer Injuries. You automatically suffer an Injury of a specified amount, depending on how far you fell. It is assigned to a random part of your body.

If you fall:
10ft - Mild injury
20ft - Serious injury
30ft - Critical injury
40 ft - Death

If you drop intentionally:
20ft - Mild injury
30ft - Serious injury
40ft - Critical injury
50ft - Death

The Injury can maim, or even kill, just as if you suffered an Injury from an Attack. Assign the Injury to a random location on your body. Roll a d4: a (1) means you landed on your head, which is Vulnerable. A (2) means you landed on an arm, a (3) on a leg (both Brim). Finally, a (4) means you landed square on your torso (Bulk).

The circumstances of the fall could increase or decrease its deadliness. Falling onto soft snow would reduce the deadliness, while falling onto jagged rocks would increase it.

### Random Injuries
If you ever need to determine a truly randomized Injury, the below chart can be of use. Roll a d12 and consult the chart below.

d12 Result | Location | Severity
--- | --- | ---
1 | head | critical
2 | head | serious
3 | head | mild
4 | leg | critical
5 | leg | serious
6 | leg | mild
7 | arm | critical
8 | arm | serious
9 | arm | mild
10 | chest | critical
11 | chest | serious
12 | chest | mild
