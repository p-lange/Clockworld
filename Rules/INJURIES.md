## INJURIES
Throughout play, Your character will suffer Injuries. [I think maybe we don't need to talk about threat injuries here. We're telling the players how to play the game. - Daniel] Injuries come in three degrees of severity: Mild, Serious, and Critical. The higher the degree of the Injury, the more likely your character will go into Shock and die (see Going into Shock below).

There are seven total injury slots: (4) Mild, (2) Serious, and (1) Critical. Once a character has 4 mild injuries, any further mild injury results are marked as serious injuries. Once a character has 2 serious inuries, any further serious injuries are marked as critical injuries. Once a character has a critical injuy, any further critical injuries kill that character.

>*For example, Mudo has taken quite a beating, having taken (4) Mild Injuries from thugs in a bar brawl. A thug punches him again, inflicting another Mild Injury. However, since there are no more slots for Mild Injuries, it fills in a Serious Injury slot on his sheet, and he'll need to start making Shock Checks just like if he had suffered an actual Serious Injury.*

[Are there types of injuries that we need to describe? What does it mean to have a broken limb, etc.? Where will you talk about how to determine and describe injuries to players?- Daniel]

## Mild Injuries
Scrapes, flesh wounds, bruises, and minor cuts. A mild inury does not directly affect your character.
#### Recovering from Mild Injuries
With one minute of unimpeded rest, your character recovers from all mild injuries. 

## Serious Injuries
Gashes, lacerations, bleeding cuts, and badly sprained or even broken limbs. When Seriously Injured, your character goes into shock and you must make Endure Rank Checks every minute.
#### Recovering from Serious Injuries
After two nights of Rest, or one night of Medical Rest - such as bandaging, splints, and stiches - your character recovers from their Serious Injuries. 

## Critical Injuries
Gut shots, gushing wounds, and severed limbs. When critically injured, your character goes into shock and you must make Endure Rank Checks at the end of evvery player turn.
#### Recovering from Critical Injuries
After 10 nights of Rest, or 5 days of Medical Rest, your character recovers from their Critical Injury.

**Instant Death -** If your charcacter suffers a Critical Injury to a Vulnerable spot on their body, they are killed immediately.

## Going into Shock and Dying
While your character is in Shock, you must make Endure Rank Checks to avoid Dying. You must make these checks every minute if your character is Seriously Injured or at the end of every Player Turn if your character is Critically Injured. If you fail this check three times, your character falls unconscious and starts Dying. While Dying, you must make an Endure Rank Check at the end of each Player turn. If you fail this check three times, your character dies.

The difficulty of the Endure Rank Check depends on how severe your Injuries are:

Injury Level | Difficulty
--- | ---
Seriously Injured | Adept
Critically Injured | Master

### Stabilizing
While a character is in Shock, you may use the Stabilize task on them. The Difficulty increases with the severity of the character's Injuries (see below). If the Stabilize Task succeeds, that character is Stable. Removes any tracked failures - you no longer need to make Endure Rank Checks to avoid Dying. Receiving any new Injury after whhile Stable causes your character to go into Shock again.

The Difficulty of the Stabilize Task is determined by how severely Injured the character is:

Injury Level | Difficulty
--- | ---
Severely Injured | Adept
Critically Injured | Master

If you have a First Aid kit, you may High Roll this Check.

## Recovering from Injuries
[Where do you talk about treating injuries? - DW]
The Difficulty of the Rank Check to treat Injuries increases the more severe the Injuries are. Using a Medicine Kit reduces the Difficulty by (1). Medical Rest can be accomplished by spending your Rest in the care of a physician or healer, and significantly expedites the recovery process. Spending all of your time, not just your sleeping hours, in Medical Rest counts as (2) nights of Rest for the purposes of recovery from Injuries.

## Resistance and Vulnerability
Some Targets will be armored or more durable than normal, which makes them Resistant to some types of Injury. Generally, Armor will specify what parts of a character's body are protected and against what types of weapons. For example, a metal shield is Resistant to sharp weapons, while a padded helmet might be Resistant to blunt weapons.

If a Target is Resistant to the type of Injury your character would receive, reduce its severity by one grade. Critical Injuries become Serious, Serious become Mild, and Mild are negated.

If a Target is Vulnerable to the type of Injury your character would receive, increase its severity by one grade. Mild become Serious, Serious become Critical, and Critical Injuries result in death.

## Maiming
When your character suffers an Injury to a limb, it may temporarily or permanently damage that limb. A limb that has suffered a Serious or Critical Injury becomes useless until that Injury has been removed - a leg cannot be walked on, forcing you to crawl or an arm hangs limp, unable to hold or wield a weapon. Some weapons or effects may destroy or sever a limb entirely when inflicting a Critical Injury, preventing the limb from every being used again!

## Falling
When your character falls from a great height, they can suffer Injuries. Your character automatically suffers an Injury of a specified severity, depending on how far they fell. It is assigned to a random part of your body.

If your character falls:
10ft - Mild injury
20ft - Serious injury
30ft - Critical injury
40 ft - Death

If your character drops intentionally:
20ft - Mild injury
30ft - Serious injury
40ft - Critical injury
50ft - Death

The Injury can maim, or even kill, just as if your character suffered an Injury from an Attack. Assign the Injury to a random location on your body (see Random Injuries below).

The circumstances of the fall could increase or decrease its deadliness. Falling onto soft snow would reduce the severity of the Injury suffered by one grade, while falling onto jagged rocks would increase it.

### Random Injuries
If you ever need to apply an Injury to a random location on your character's body, roll a d6 and consult the chart below.

d6 Result | Location
--- | ---
1 | head
2 | right arm
3 | left arm
4 | right leg
5 | left leg
6 | chest
