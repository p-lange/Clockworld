# Zombies
Zombies are a staple of the horror genre, and can be used to create some truly tense scenarios for your players. A single zombie is little more than a nuisance, but a ravenous pack of them can be quite deadly. A zombie’s slow Speed makes it easy pickings at a distance. However, if several zombies get their hands on a player, they’ll tear him to shreds in no time. Zombies should generally be used in Hordes, as a single zombie is not much of a challenge.

## Behavior
### Simple and Easily Distracted
Zombies will chase after any loud noise they hear, and are particularly drawn to the screams of the living. A sufficiently loud noise off in the distance is sometimes enough to draw a Horde away from the players.
```
```
### Merciless and Ravenous
Zombies care nothing for themselves or others -- they fear nothing, feel no pain, and do not concern themselves with the wellbeing of other zombies. They care only to feed, though their hunger can never be quenched. When a zombie has a victim in its hands, it will continue to try to devour it until the body is completely consumed, or the zombie is distracted by a more *lively* nearby victim.
