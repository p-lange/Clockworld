Threat Types

Individuals - each Action of each character is played out. Players attack and kill them individually in an intimate, brutal battle.

Groups - a group of Individuals (countable number). The GM controls them in more broad-strokes. They move as a unit (simultaneously) and perform “volleys” of attacks.

Hordes - massive groups with uncountable numbers. They overrun and kill individual players easily. They cause attacks as a single unit, harming anything nearby. Example, hundreds of rioters. They throw rocks and bottles, break windows and doors, and simply harm anyone that gets within a stone’s throw. Killing an individual rioter does nothing to quell the numbers, you cannot hope to kill them all with traditional weaponry. Groups or Individuals can break off from Hordes, allowing the players to interact with them on a more personal level.
	-Makes Attacks and Checks as a single group, affecting things nearby.
	-Moves and performs one Horde Action.
	-Doesn’t make “Attacks” in the normal sense. It’s more like, you are subject to the Horde’s Attack if you’re nearby. You can duck for cover to avoid ranged, but if you’re in Melee it’d be some sort of Contest, and you’re subject to a number of Injuries depending on how much you failed by.
		
Riot! Horde Attack (+4) vs Take Cover. The Damage Pool is composed of a number of d20s equal to the amount the Horde wins the Contest. (Blunt)
	-ALTERNATIVE: Suffer an amount of Injuries equal to points won in Contest? Probably too deadly and doesn’t interact with Armor well.

	-Trample: Knocked Prone, subject to 1d4 Random Injuries. 


Individuals: normal Actions/rolls.
Groups: all perform the same Attack/Check, and the Defender simply contests/reacts ONCE and it applies to all of them. Any Attacks that get through resolve as normal.
Hordes: have special Horde Actions; they attack/injure/etc everything near them.


Horde Actions Ideas

Horde Attacks and Resistance: if the victim’s Bulk is Resistant to the Injuries of the Horde Attack, reduce the total number of Injuries suffered by half, rounded up.

Trample: the Horde moves over anyone in their way, trampling them underfoot. The Horde makes a Contest against the victims’ Dodge. For each point the Horde wins the Contest, the victims suffer (1) random Blunt (d12) Injury and is knocked Prone.

Bombard: the Horde throws small objects, like rocks and bottles, at anyone not within the Horde that is within 50ft of it. Targets can React by Blocking or Taking Cover from the Bombardment. For each point the Horde wins the Contest, the victims suffer (1) random Blunt (d20) Injury. Targets at Long Range can High Roll their Block and Take Cover Checks.

Shred: the Horde tears, beats, and assaults anyone foolish enough to come within its Reach. The Horde catches hold of anyone within (5) feet of it, and begins to attack them. Targets can React by Dodging or Blocking. For each point the Horde wins the Contest, the victims suffer (1) random Blunt (d8) Injury. 

Open Fire: the Horde lets loose a barrage of Ranged Attacks at anyone it can see within range of its weapons. Targets can React by Blocking or Taking Cover from the barrage of shots. For each point the Horde wins the Contest, the victims suffer (1) random Ballistic or Sharp (d8) Injury, depending on the weaponry of the Horde.
